In order to build for debugging purposes:

1) Make sure you have the Rust command line interface installed (type "cargo --version" -- mine is 1.57.0)
2) Run the command "cargo build"
3) Execute ./target/debug/a_prototype to see the current working demo. (Currently, it isn't very impressive! Just press ESC to exit.)
